Genetic Algorithm and Linear integer programming solve Sudoku

The project contain two parts, the genetic algorithm part and the linear integer programming part.

All steps based on the Jupiter Notebook. 

For GA, put required puzzle csv file under the Jupiter default path, type the name of that file into s.load(" "). Process the code, the solution will automatically save into solution.txt.

For LIP, put required puzzle csv file under the Jupiter default path, type the name of that file into s.load(" "). Process the code, the solution will automatically save into "result_"+file_name.

Random select 1000 worked as randomly select 1000 rows from input csv(need put the file at the path of your reader) and output a new csv file with new selected rows.
